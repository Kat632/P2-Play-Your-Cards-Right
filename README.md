## **Overview**

** **
 
This is the second Project for the **Full Stack Web Development Diploma** from [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net).

**Background to the project and why I decided to build this particular game**

Imagine if you will, it's 1986-ish, and an 8 year old girl sitting bored in her bedroom.  She starts flicking through some random books that have been left next to the family computer, the Acorn Electron.  Her dad got all these books when he bought the Acorn second-hand off a mate of his.  No one ever looks at the books though.  They're just there gathering dust.

The little girl opens up one of the books and discovers a whole world of computer manipulation inside.  She doesn't know what any of it means, but by looking at the pictures, she realised that the computer can do all sorts of interesting things that she'd not seen it do before.  THis is how I started coding.

One of the programs in the book was to code a basic Higher or Lower card game which I can distinctly remember doing.  I have no memory at all of debugging it, so either it worked first time or I sat an went through it line by line, character by character looking for mistakes!

Incidentally, there was an official Play Your Cards Right game for the Acorn Electron.  [Please see here if you are interested](http://www.acornelectron.co.uk/eug/revs/britannia/Play_Your_Cards_Right_000.html).

This website has been built using the knowledge gained from the HTML, CSS and JavaScript modules of Code Institute's FullStack Web Development course.

## **UX**

** **


**1. Strategy**

To ensure the UX is simple and user-friendly, by providing easy navigation through all pages on the site.

### **User stories**

**Visitor Goals**

*	As a website visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the website and learn more about the organisation.

*	As a website visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate through the site to find content.

*	As a website visitor, I want to be able to view the website clearly on any mobile device.

*	As a website visitor, I want to know what services are provided by the organisation.

*	As a website visitor, I would like to see examples of previous projects undertaken by the organisation.

**Client Goals**

*	To have a more visually pleasing website than the current version [https://rapiergroup.co.uk/](https://rapiergroup.co.uk/).

*	To minimise the risk of information overload, by condensing the text into a more readable layout.

* 	The website must represent the client and their business in a professional manner.  No visual gimmicks or massive menus.


**2. Scope**

*	To create a fluid and responsive layout for ease of use on common devices.

*	To fine-tune and implement the skills I have learnt so far on my course.


**3. Structure**

I designed this website to create a more modern and eye-catching version of the original website.  See above for link to original website.  The original website was built by Clive Pearson using a Wordpress template.  My version of the website utilises modern internet protocols to create a more aethetically pleasing experience for the user.


**4. Skeleton**

*	Wireframes - please see below in the Design section.

*	Fixed footer for the purpose of a strong and constantly present Call To Action.

*	Home page, Planning page, Tactics page, Contact page.


**5. Surface**

Please see Design section below.

## **Design**

** **


### **Colour Scheme**




### **Typography**

The website uses two fonts throughout.  The header and buttons throughout the website are using the [**Press2P Start**](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Press+Start+2P) font while the main text is using the [**Tienne**](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Tienne#standard-styles) font.  Both fonts are from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).  

I chose **Press 2P Start** because I had used it previously in the [**Code Institute**](https://codeinstitute.net/) Retro Hackathon in August 2021.  I like its retro 1980s feel, even though it is based on the Namco arcade game fonts of the time and therefore nothing to do with the Acorn Electron.

I chose **Tienne** because it reminds me of the original font from the opening screen of the British TV Show Play Your Cards Right.  [This is a link to a Google image search of the TV show](https://tinyurl.com/nxxx6unj).

** **

## **Testing**

** **


## **Functionality Testing**

I used Mozilla Web Developer Tools and Chrome Developer Tools throughout the project for testing and solving problems with responsiveness and style issues.

## **Compatibility Testing**

The site has been tested across multiple virtual devices and browsers using developer tools.  Browser testing on Safari, Edge, Firefox and Chrome.

The site has been tested across multiple non-virtual devices, including iPhone 8 and iPad Mini 2.

## **Performance testing**

All pages pass through [Google Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) with no major concerns, except for the empty values in the aria-required labels on the form fields.  These have been changed to aria-required="true".

## **Accessibility Testing**

Accessibility testing using [WebAim Wave - Web Acessibility Evaluation Tool](https://wave.webaim.org/)

## **Code Validation**

Testing has been carried out using the following web services:

HTML on all pages validated using [The W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/)
CSS validated using [The W3C CSS Validation Service](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

## **Code Validation Issues**

When validating the tactics.html page, an issue was revealed in that you cannot have a h3 element as a descendant of a th element.  Therefore I had to remove the h3 element and I have restyled **th.Rtable-cell** to mimic a h3 element.

## **Peer Code Review**

At the suggestion of my mentor I submitted my code for Peer Code Review in the **Code Institute** Slack channel.  Please see the names of the reviewers below in [Acknowledgements](#acknowledgements).

The results were:
*	A bug on the 404 page whereby the Rapier Group text in the top left of the page does not link back to the home page - Fixed.
*	A suggestion to left-align the text in the list container on planning.html, so that the bullets aren't floating separately to the text - Fixed and it looks so much better now.
*	Consider adding more space below the table on tactics.html as it was slightly overlapped by the footer element - Fixed.

## **User Testing**

**Visitor Goals**

> As a website visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the website and learn more about the organisation.
>
>> The name of the business and what the company does is evident on the home page.  The different sections on the home page provide more opportunity to learn about the organisation.

> As a website visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate through the site to find content.
>
>> Each page has a navigation bar at the top allowing the user to navigate between the pages.  Since the home page is longer than the others, a back-to-top button has been included to allow the user to quickly get back to the top of the page where the navigation bar is.

> As a website visitor, I want to be able to view the website clearly on any mobile device.
>
>> The website is responsive at different screen widths.  For a description of the responsive features, please see [Features](#features).

> As a website visitor, I want to know what services are provided by the organisation.
>
>> The Planning and Tactics pages provide information about the services provided by Rapier Marketing.

> As a website visitor, I would like to see examples of previous projects undertaken by the organisation.
>
>> The Past Projects and Testimonials sections on the home page provide information about what the organisation has previously undertaken.

## **Resources**

** **

*	The basic structure of this project was built using this course on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-card-game/).  I did not feel confident enough about my javaScript skills to build what I wanted to build from scratch after I finished the lessons leading up to this project.  However, I feel the project I have built is sufficiently different from the one on Udemy to be able to submit it.  I have styled the project, added the functions for the sound and for the prizes by myself.  As a result, I feel like my understanding of javaScript has greatly improved.

*	In making the toggle sound on/off, this was the resource that finally helped me make it work [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39041960/how-to-unmute-html5-video-with-a-muted-prop)

*	W3 Schools
