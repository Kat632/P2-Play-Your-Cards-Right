## **Overview**

** **
 
This is the second Project for the **Full Stack Web Development Diploma** from [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net).

**Background to the project and why I decided to build this particular game**

Imagine if you will, it's 1986-ish, and an 8 year old girl sitting bored in her bedroom.  She starts flicking through some random books that have been left next to the family computer, the Acorn Electron.  Her dad got all the books when he bought the Acorn second-hand off his mate.  No one ever looks at the books though.  They're just there gathering dust.

The little girl opens up one of the books and discovers a whole world of computer manipulation inside.  She doesn't know what any of it means, but by looking at the pictures, she realised that the computer can do all sorts of interesting things that she'd not seen it do before.  This is how I started coding.

One of the programs in the book was to code a basic Higher or Lower card game which I can distinctly remember doing.  I have no memory at all of debugging it, so either it worked first time or I sat an went through it line by line, character by character looking for mistakes!

Incidentally, there was an official Play Your Cards Right game for the Acorn Electron.  [Please see here.](http://www.acornelectron.co.uk/eug/revs/britannia/Play_Your_Cards_Right_000.html).

## **UX**

** **


**1. Strategy**

To ensure the UX is simple and user-friendly, by providing easy navigation through all pages on the site.

### **User stories**

**User Goals**

*	The site's users want to understand how to play the game.
*	The site’s users want to play an online game that has elements of chance.
*	The site's users want to play a game that can potentially have a different outcome every time they play it.

**Site Owner Goals**

*	The site’s goal is to provide a challenging game with the ability to "win" money and prizes, just like on the old TV programme.

Potential features to include:

*	Betting functionality.
*	The ability to go bust.
*	The ability to win a prize based on the final score.

**2. Scope**

*	To create a fluid and responsive layout for ease of use on common devices.

*	To fine-tune and implement the skills I have learnt so far on my course.

*	To provide a visually pleasing retro game environment to entertain the user.


**3. Structure**

I designed this website to have a retro look since, as stated previously, it is based loosely around the old 1980s TV show and computer game.

I wanted the layout to be visually simple.


**4. Skeleton**

*	Wireframes - please see below in the Design section.

*	Fixed footer for the purpose of always displaying the author of the game to the user.

*	Fixed header for the purpose of displaying the name of the game to the user.

*	Play area in the middle of the screen that displays the various elements of the game.

*	Sound toggle button and game play buttons are always in the same place.


**5. Surface**

Please see Design section below.

## **Design**

** **

### **Colour Scheme**

I used [**Coolors**](https://coolors.co/) to generate a suitably retro-looking colour scheme and then modified it for my own purposes.  The background colour #B4B8AB reminds me of the plastic on the CRT monitors that were around at the time.  The pink colour #8E4A49, used on one of the buttons, reminds me of the carpet in the bathroom(!) at my parents' house during the 1980s.

I used EightShapes Contrast Grid to test the foreground and background colour combinations for minimum contrast compliance.

### **Typography**

The website uses two fonts throughout.  The header and buttons throughout the website are using the [**Press2P Start**](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Press+Start+2P) font while the main text is using the [**Tienne**](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Tienne#standard-styles) font.  Both fonts are from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).  

I chose **Press 2P Start** because I had used it previously in the [**Code Institute**](https://codeinstitute.net/) Retro Hackathon in August 2021.  I like its retro 1980s feel, even though it is based on the Namco arcade game fonts of the time and therefore nothing to do with the Acorn Electron.

I chose **Tienne** because it reminds me of the original font from the opening screen of the British TV Show Play Your Cards Right.  [This is a link to a Google image search of the TV show](https://tinyurl.com/nxxx6unj).


### **Imagery**

*	The background is by [Amanda Jones](https://unsplash.com/@amandagraphc) on Unsplash.  I chose it because it represents the game.

*	The fountain pen is by [Shutterbug75](https://pixabay.com/users/shutterbug75-2077322/) on Pixabay.  I chose it because the consolation prizes on 1980s British TV shows were generally something rubbish, like a clock or a pen.  See this [Metro](https://metro.co.uk/2015/03/10/bullys-special-prize-why-game-shows-were-better-in-the-70s-and-80s-5050086/) article I used for inspiration.

*	The Casio watch photo was taken by my husband, [Chris Morley](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-morley-11620815/) and it is from his collection of 1980s technology.  A digital watch was considered the height of geeky sophistication at the time and are still considered a quintessential part of 1980s design today.

*	The speedboat image was taken by [Anthony Formin](https://unsplash.com/@aginsbrook) and I chose it because it is an old-looking speedboat with a family in it.  Speedboats were often given away as prizes on game shows in the 1980s.  It was always a source of amusement to my family that Barry from Wigan would be parking a speedboat outside his two-bedroomed terraced house.  I felt that this paticular boat represented the look and feel of family-oriented game shows of the time.  I originally had a fancier boat, but it felt too modern.

*	The cruise photo is by [Alonso Reyes](https://unsplash.com/@alonsoreyes) on Unsplash.  I chose to have a world cruise as one of the prizes because people did win luxury holidays on the quiz shows of the time.

* The image of the Mini car is from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mini).  I chose it because I watched the very first episode of [Play Your Cards Right on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4jW_OGwXus) and the star prize was a Mini.

### **Differences to Design**

*   I decided to leave the footer at the bottom of the page during game play.  It looks neater and it provides the user with the name and social links of the author of the game at all times.

*   I was going to have the cards overlapping on smaller screen sizes, but in the end I decided it was going to be quicker to let them just be side by side, like on all other screen sizes.

### **Limitations**

** **

## **Testing**

** **


## **Functionality Testing**

I used Mozilla Web Developer Tools and Chrome Developer Tools throughout the project for testing and solving problems with responsiveness and style issues.

## **Compatibility Testing**

The site has been tested across multiple virtual devices and browsers using developer tools.  Browser testing on Safari, Edge, Firefox and Chrome.

The site has been tested across multiple non-virtual devices, including iPhone 8 and iPad Mini 2.

## **Performance testing**

All pages pass through [Google Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) with a score of 94 for performance and no major concerns.

## **Accessibility Testing**

Accessibility testing using [WebAim Wave - Web Acessibility Evaluation Tool](https://wave.webaim.org/)

## **Code Validation**

Testing has been carried out using the following web services:

HTML on all pages validated using [The W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/)

CSS validated using [The W3C CSS Validation Service](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

JavaScript code has been validated using [JSHint](https://jshint.com/)

## **Code Validation Issues**

When validating the HTML code, an issue was revealed in that you cannot have a type="" in an audio tag.  This has now been removed.

## **Peer Code Review**

At the suggestion of my mentor I submitted my code for Peer Code Review in the **Code Institute** Slack channel.  Please see the names of the reviewers below in [Acknowledgements](#acknowledgements).

The results were:

## **Resources**

** **

*	The basic structure of this project was built using this course on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-card-game/).  I did not feel confident enough about my JavaScript skills to build what I wanted to build from scratch after I finished the lessons leading up to this project.  However, I feel the project I have built is sufficiently different from the one on Udemy to be able to submit it.  I have styled the project, added the functions for the sound and for the prizes by myself.  As a result, I feel like my understanding of JavaScript has greatly improved through doing the Udemy course to build the basic structure of the game and through building up my project into a visually attractive and fun game to play.

*	In making the toggle sound on/off, this was the resource that finally helped me make it work [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39041960/how-to-unmute-html5-video-with-a-muted-prop)
